# Game Plan
## Thomas Chemmanoor


### Breakout Variant
Jet ball was the most interesting variant to me since I always thought of breakout as having stationary bricks. The concentric circle level seemed very interesting. I will try to include one of those levels in my game or make all levels like this. 

### General Level Descriptions
1st Level - Big Concentric circle of circular bricks that are all moving in the same direction. Outer bricks should need multiple hits to break.

2nd Level - Two Concentric circles of circular bricks that are moving in different directions.


### Bricks Ideas
Normal bricks- require one hit with ball to break - 100 points

Metal bricks - require 2 hits with ball to break - 300 points


### Power Up Ideas

Speed up Paddle - Increases paddle speed by 2 

Slow Down Balls - Slows down ball/balls by a certain amount

### Cheat Key Ideas

C key will prevent the ball from being able to leave the map from the bottom. Essentially Immortality.

M key will make ball metal and allow the player to be able to break all bricks with one hit

### Something Extra

Printing out the player's score when the player either dies or finishes the game!
This is an important new feature since without it, two players who play the game will not be able to unedrstand how good they are at the game compared to the other person.
