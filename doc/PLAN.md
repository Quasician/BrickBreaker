# Game Plan

### Breakout Variant
Jet ball was the most interesting variant to me since I always thought of breakout as having stationary bricks. The concentric circle level seemed very interesting. I will try to include one of those levels in my game or make all levels like this. 

### General Level Descriptions
1st Level - Big Concentric circle of bricks with 1hp that are all moving in the same direction.

2nd Level - Two Concentric circles of bricks that are moving in different directions. Outer bricks should need multiple hits to break.

3rd Level - Three Concentric circles of bricks that are moving in different directions. Outer bricks should need multiple hits to break. Innermost ring should require multiple hits and drop powerups.

### Bricks Ideas
Normal bricks- require one hit with ball to break - 100 points

Metal bricks - require 2 hits with ball to break - 300 points

Obsidian bricks - require 3 hits with ball to break - 500 points

### Power Up Ideas

Speed up Paddle - Increases paddle speed by 2 

Slow Down Balls - Slows down ball/balls by a certain amount

Increased Paddle Length - Increases the size of the paddle

### Cheat Key Ideas
L adds additional lives to the player

R resets the ball and paddle to starting positions

1-9 takes player to that corresponding level

Extra: C key will prevent the ball from being able to leave the map from the bottom. Essentially Immortality.


### Something Extra

Printing out the highest player's score from a text file when the player finishes the game!
This is an important new feature since without it no player will know how good they are in relation to the best.
